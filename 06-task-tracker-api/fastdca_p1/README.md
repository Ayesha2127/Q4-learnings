FastDCA Task Tracker API – Phase 1
A modular, scalable task tracking API built with FastAPI, designed to support efficient task management workflows. This project is part of the Q4 Learnings initiative and represents the foundational backend for a task tracker application.

🚀 Project Overview
The FastDCA Task Tracker API provides a RESTful interface for managing tasks, users, and related data. It is structured to support future enhancements such as authentication, role-based access control, and frontend integration.

📚 What I Learned
During the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience with the following:
Setting up a FastAPI project with a clean and modular structure.
Defining and using SQLAlchemy models for database interactions.
Creating RESTful API routes using FastAPI's routing system.
Utilizing Pydantic for request validation and data serialization.
Running a development server with uvicorn.
Preparing a project for scalability and future enhancements like authentication and deployment.

This project deepened my understanding of backend development using Python and FastAPI, and prepared me for more advanced applications.



🧩 Future Enhancements
User Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication.
Role-Based Access Control: Define user roles and permissions.
Database Integration: Connect to a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Frontend Interface: Develop a user-friendly frontend using React or Vue.js.
Deployment: Containerize the application using Docker for deployment.
