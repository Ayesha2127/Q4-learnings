Project Overview â€“ fastdca_p1
The fastdca_p1 project is a hands-on implementation of RESTful APIs using FastAPI and Pydantic. The goal was to understand backend development fundamentals including API creation, data validation, and routing in Python.

ðŸ”§ Key Concepts Demonstrated
FastAPI Framework
Built a web API using FastAPI, defining endpoints to handle HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Pydantic Models
Used Pydantic to validate incoming and outgoing data. This ensures data correctness, such as type checks and required fields.

Modular Code Structure
Organized code into separate files â€” for example, keeping routes in their own module. This promotes clean and maintainable code.

Dummy Data Handling
Simulated a backend using lists or dictionaries to manage in-memory data (like users or items). This was used for performing operations like creating, updating, and deleting records.

Interactive Documentation
Took advantage of FastAPIâ€™s built-in Swagger UI at /docs to view and test APIs in real time.

ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
How to create and structure a FastAPI project professionally.

How to define Pydantic models to validate and serialize data.

The concept of modular routing and scalable API design.

How CRUD operations are implemented in real-world APIs.

Importance of clean code structure and auto-documentation.
