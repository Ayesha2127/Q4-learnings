What is Generative AI? 
Generative AI, short for Generative Artificial Intelligence, is a smart technology that can create new things just like humans do. It can write stories, draw images, make music, create videos, 
or even write computer code. It learns from huge amounts of data and then uses that knowledge to generate new content. 


How Does Generative AI Work? 
Generative AI uses machine learning, especially a technique called deep learning. It trains on a lot of data like books, images, and sounds. 
Then, it finds patterns and usesthose patterns to create new things. 

There are two main types of models used: 

Transformers: These work best with language and text (like ChatGPT). 
Diffusion Models: These are used to generate images (like DALL·E, Midjourney).
